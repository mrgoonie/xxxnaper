1. Installation Guide
2. Initialization Guide
3. Authentication Guide
4. Configuration Management Guide
5. Cheatsheet for quick reference

### Production Deployment (2-3 hours)
1. Installation Guide

## Documentation Statistics

- **Total Documentation:** ~200+ KB across 15+ files
- **Code Examples:** 150+ production-ready examples
- **Commands Documented:** 100+ gcloud commands
- **Topics Covered:** 50+ major topics
- **Sections:** 100+ detailed sections

## Key Takeaways

### Authentication Priority
1. **Application Default Credentials (ADC)** - Recommended for applications
2. **Service Account Impersonation** - Recommended for development/production
3. **Workload Identity Federation** - For external systems (no keys)
4. **User Credentials** - For interactive development only
5. **Avoid Service Account Keys** - Static credentials are security risk

### Configuration Strategy
- Use named configurations for multiple environments
- Properties have clear precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config files > defaults
- Switch configurations instantly with `gcloud config configurations activate`

### Scripting Best Practices
- Use JSON output format for parsing
- Implement server-side filtering for efficiency
- Add error handling with exponential backoff
- Use `--async` for parallel operations
- Implement idempotent operations (check before create)

### Security Requirements
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use service account impersonation instead of key files
- Grant minimal IAM permissions (least privilege)
- Rotate keys regularly (90 days recommended)
- Enable Cloud Audit Logs for compliance
