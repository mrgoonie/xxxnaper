## Multi-Image Composition

When combining multiple input images:

### Clarity in Intent

Be specific about how images should combine:

```

"Create a collage layout with these three images arranged horizontally"
```

### Style Consistency

Specify unified visual treatment:

```
"Combine these images with consistent lighting and color palette"

"Blend these photos seamlessly into a single cohesive scene"
```

### Recommended Limits

- **Maximum**: 3 input images for best results
- Fewer images generally produce higher quality
- More images increase complexity and potential inconsistencies

## Image Editing

When modifying existing images:

"Add a person walking in the background"
```

### Removal Instructions

## Aspect Ratio Selection

Choose based on use case:

## Iterative Refinement

### Multi-Turn Conversations

Build on previous generations:

**Turn 1**: "A cozy coffee shop interior"
**Turn 2**: "Add warm lighting from hanging Edison bulbs"
**Turn 3**: "Add a person reading by the window"
**Turn 4**: "Make the scene more vibrant and inviting"

### Progressive Enhancement

Start broad, then add specifics:

1. "A mountain landscape"
2. "A snow-capped mountain landscape at sunset"
3. "A dramatic snow-capped mountain landscape at golden hour with reflecting alpine lake in foreground"
4. "...professional landscape photography, 35mm lens, deep focus"

## Common Patterns

### Portrait Photography

```
"Professional portrait of [subject], natural lighting, shallow depth of field, 85mm lens, soft focus background, warm tones"
```

### Product Photography

```
"Commercial product photo of [product], studio lighting, white background, sharp focus, high resolution, professional photography"
```

### Architectural Photography

```
"Architectural photography of [building], wide-angle lens, dramatic perspective, blue hour lighting, HDR, professional quality"
```

## Prompt Optimization Tips

### Experiment with Variations

Try different phrasings:
- "A robot in a city" vs. "Urban robot scene" vs. "Futuristic android walking through metropolis"

### Layer Details Gradually

Start simple, add complexity:
1. Basic: "A forest"
2. Enhanced: "A misty forest at dawn"
3. Detailed: "A mystical misty forest at dawn with rays of sunlight filtering through ancient trees"

### Use Positive Phrasing

Focus on what you want, not what you don't want:
❌ "A landscape without people or buildings"
✓ "An untouched natural wilderness landscape"

### Combine Modifiers

Stack quality and style terms:
"Professional high-quality photorealistic portrait, studio lighting, 4K, sharp focus"

### Reference Visual Elements

Use concrete visual descriptors:
- Instead of "pretty flowers" → "vibrant red roses with morning dew droplets"
- Instead of "nice building" → "modern glass skyscraper with reflective facade"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too vague**: "A nice picture"
❌ **Conflicting styles**: "Photorealistic cartoon watercolor"
❌ **Over-complicated**: 500-word detailed prompt
❌ **Too many subjects**: "A cat, dog, bird, fish, hamster, and turtle"
❌ **Negative instructions**: "Don't make it dark or blurry"

✓ **Clear and focused**: "A playful golden retriever puppy in a sunny garden, natural photography"
