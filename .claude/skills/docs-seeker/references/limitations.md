# Limitations & Success Criteria

Understanding boundaries and measuring effectiveness of documentation discovery.

## Cannot Handle

### Password-Protected Documentation

**Limitation:**
- No access to authentication-required content
- Cannot log in to platforms
- No credential management
- Cannot access organization-internal docs

**Impact:**
- Enterprise documentation inaccessible
- Premium content unavailable
- Private beta docs unreachable
- Internal wikis not readable

**Workarounds:**
```
- Ask user for public alternatives
- Search for public subset of docs
- Use publicly available README/marketing
- Check if trial/demo access available
- Note limitation in report
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
⚠️ **Access Limitation**

Documentation requires authentication.

**What we can access**:
- Public README: [url]
- Package registry info: [url]
- Marketing site: [url]

**Cannot access**:
- Full documentation (requires login)
- Internal guides
- Premium content

**Recommendation**: Contact vendor for access or check if public docs available.
```

### Rate-Limited APIs

**Limitation:**
- No API credentials for authenticated access
- Subject to anonymous rate limits
- Cannot request increased limits
- No retry with authentication

**Impact:**
- Limited requests per hour (e.g., GitHub: 60/hour anonymous)
- May hit limits during comprehensive search
- Slower fallback required
- Incomplete coverage possible

**Workarounds:**
```
- Add delays between requests
- Use alternative sources (cached, mirrors)
- Prioritize critical pages
- Use Researcher agents instead of API
- Switch to repository analysis
```

**Detection:**
```
Symptoms:
- 429 Too Many Requests
- X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
- Slow or refused connections

Response:
- Immediately switch to alternative method
- Don't retry same endpoint
- Note in report which method used
```

### Real-Time Documentation

**Limitation:**
- Uses snapshot at time of access
- Cannot monitor for updates
- No real-time synchronization
- May miss very recent changes

**Impact:**
- Documentation updated minutes ago may not be reflected
- Breaking changes announced today might be missed
- Latest release notes may not be current
- Version just released may not be documented

**Workarounds:**
```
- Note access date in report
- Recommend user verify if critical
- Check last-modified headers
- Compare with release dates
- Suggest official site for latest
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
ℹ️ **Snapshot Information**

Documentation retrieved: 2025-10-26 14:30 UTC

**Last-Modified** (if available):
- Main docs: 2025-10-24
- API reference: 2025-10-22

**Note**: For real-time updates, check official site: [url]
```

- Note: "Example provided, not tested"
- Recommend user run examples
- Link to interactive playground if available
- Include caveats about untested code
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
## Example Usage

```python
# Example from official docs (not tested)
import library
result = library.do_thing()
```

⚠️ **Note**: Example provided from documentation but not executed.
Please test in your environment.

**Interactive playground**: [url if available]
```

### Video-Only Documentation

**Limitation:**
- Cannot process video content directly
- Limited transcript access
- Cannot extract code from video
- Cannot parse visual diagrams

**Impact:**
- Video tutorials not usable
- YouTube courses inaccessible
- Screencasts not processable
- Visual walkthroughs unavailable

**Workarounds:**
```
- Search for transcript if available
- Look for accompanying blog post
- Find text-based alternative
- Check for community notes
- Use automated captions if available (low quality)
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
ℹ️ **Video Content Detected**

Primary documentation is video-based: [url]

**Alternatives found**:
- Blog post summary: [url]
- Community notes: [url]

**Cannot extract**:
- Detailed walkthrough from video
- Visual examples

**Recommendation**: Watch video directly for visual content.
```

## May Struggle With

### Very Large Repositories (>1GB)

**Challenge:**
- Repomix may fail or hang
- Clone takes very long time
- Processing exceeds memory limits
- Output file too large to read

**Success rate:** ~30% for >1GB repos

**Mitigation:**
```
1. Try shallow clone: git clone --depth 1
2. Focus on docs only: repomix --include "docs/**"
3. Exclude binaries: --exclude "*.png,*.jpg,dist/**"
4. If fails: Use Explorer agents on specific files
5. Note limitation in report
```

**When to skip:**
```
Repository size indicators:
- Git clone shows >1GB download
- Contains large binaries (ml models, datasets)
- Has extensive history (>10k commits)
- Many multimedia files

→ Skip Repomix, use targeted exploration
```

### Documentation in Images/PDFs

**Challenge:**
- Cannot reliably extract text from images
- PDF parsing limited
- Formatting often lost
- Code snippets may be corrupted

**Success rate:** ~50% quality for PDFs, ~10% for images

**Mitigation:**
```
1. Search for text alternative
2. Try OCR if critical (low quality)
3. Provide image URL instead
4. Note content not extractable
5. Recommend manual review
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
⚠️ **Image-Based Documentation**

Primary documentation in PDF/images: [url]

**Extraction quality**: Limited
**Recommendation**: Download and review manually

**Text alternatives found**:
- [any alternatives]
```

### Non-English Documentation

**Challenge:**
- No automatic translation
- May miss context/nuance
- Technical terms may not translate well
- Examples may be language-specific

**Success rate:** Variable (depends on user needs)

**Mitigation:**
```
1. Note language in report
2. Offer key section translation if user requests
3. Search for English version
4. Check if bilingual docs exist
5. Provide original with language note
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
ℹ️ **Language Notice**

Primary documentation in: Japanese

**English availability**:
- Partial translation: [url]
- Community translation: [url]
- No official English version found

**Recommendation**: Use translation tool or request community help.
```

### Scattered Documentation

**Challenge:**
- Multiple sites/repositories
- Inconsistent structure
- Conflicting information
- No central source

**Success rate:** ~60% coverage

**Mitigation:**
```
1. Use Researcher agents
2. Prioritize official sources
3. Cross-reference findings
4. Note conflicts clearly
5. Take longer but be thorough
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
ℹ️ **Fragmented Documentation**

Information found across multiple sources:

**Official** (incomplete):
- Website: [url]
- Package registry: [url]

**Community** (supplementary):
- Stack Overflow: [url]
- Tutorial: [url]

**Note**: No centralized documentation. Information aggregated from
multiple sources. Conflicts resolved by prioritizing official sources.
```

### Deprecated/Legacy Libraries

**Challenge:**
- Documentation removed or archived
- Only old versions available
- Outdated information
- No current maintenance

**Success rate:** ~40% for fully deprecated libraries

**Mitigation:**
```
1. Use Internet Archive (Wayback Machine)
2. Search GitHub repository history
3. Check package registry for old README
4. Look for fork with docs
5. Note legacy status clearly
```

**Report template:**
```markdown
⚠️ **Legacy Library**

**Status**: Deprecated as of [date]
**Last update**: [date]

**Documentation sources**:
- Archived docs (via Wayback): [url]
- Repository (last commit [date]): [url]

**Recommendation**: Consider modern alternative: [suggestion]

**Measures:** How quickly user gets useful information

**Targets:**
```
First useful info: <30 seconds
Core coverage: <2 minutes
Complete report: <5 minutes
```

**Tracking:**
```
Start → llms.txt found → First URL fetched → Critical info extracted
  15s        30s               45s                  60s

User can act on info at 60s mark
(even if full report takes 5 minutes)
```

### Coverage Completeness

**Measures:** Percentage of user needs met

**Calculation:**
```
User needs 5 topics:
- Installation ✓
- Basic usage ✓
- API reference ✓
- Configuration ✓
- Examples ✗ (not found)

Coverage: 4/5 = 80%
```

**Targets:**
```
Excellent: 90-100%
Good: 75-89%
Acceptable: 60-74%
Poor: <60%
```

### Source Quality

**Measures:** Reliability of sources used

**Scoring:**
```
Official docs: 100 points
Official repository: 80 points
Package registry: 60 points
Recent community (verified): 40 points
Old community (unverified): 20 points
```

**Target:** Average >70 points

### User Satisfaction Indicators

**Positive signals:**
```
- User proceeds immediately with info
- No follow-up questions needed
- User says "perfect" or "thanks"
- User marks conversation complete
```

**Negative signals:**
```
- User asks same question differently
- User requests more details
- User says "incomplete" or "not what I needed"
- User abandons task
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Learn from Failures

**When documentation discovery struggles:**

1. **Document the issue**
   ```
   - What was attempted
   - What failed
   - Why it failed
   - How it was resolved (if at all)
   ```

2. **Identify patterns**
   ```
   - Is this library-specific?
   - Is this ecosystem-specific?
   - Is this a general limitation?
   ```

3. **Update strategies**
   ```
   - Add workaround to playbook
   - Update fallback sequence
   - Note limitation in documentation
   ```

### Measure and Optimize

**Track these metrics:**
```
- Average time to complete
- Coverage percentage
- Source quality score
- User satisfaction
- Failure rate by method
```

**Optimize based on data:**
```
- Which method succeeds most often?
- Which ecosystems need special handling?
- Where are time bottlenecks?
- What causes most failures?
```
